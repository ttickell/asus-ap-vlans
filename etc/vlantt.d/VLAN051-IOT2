## This is a bit different:
##
## Use case - I have a wifi SSID specifically to have a 
## network name refer to the location its in (for stupid devices that
## can't managed to pick the closest node).
## 
## I want that SSID to *also* be on the IO VLAN 51.
## 
## We need to specify the same bridge and lan as VLAN051-IOT,
## so the tool can update the variables in nvram - because there is 
## no way in nvram to know what VLANDs we are using
VLAN_ID=51
BRIDGE_INT=br2
LAN_IFNAME=lan2
WIFI_SSID="gadgets-garage"
