## Another case - no SSID, no devices connected, just
## tag every port for a known VLAN
##
## This is only useful you might maybe plug in devices on multiple
## ports passing tagged traffic - in real life, this is probably
## something you want on a trunk port, with untagged ports added (just
## like the first example)
VLAN_ID=200
BRIDGE_INT=br3
LAN_IFNAME=lan3
PORTS_TAGGED="eth0,eth1,eth2,eth3,eth4"
